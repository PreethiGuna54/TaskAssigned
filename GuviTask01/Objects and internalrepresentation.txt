OBJECTS:
    1.Objects are the important data types in JS. Unlike primitive data types, object can hold n number of values in the KEY-VALUE form.
    2.Objects are represented by Key which will be the String type and Value could be in any of the data types.
    3.We can operate the properties of Object by using ObjName.PropertiesKey.
    4.Objects can be created by giving KEY_VALUE pairs inside {}.
    5.Javascript uses various way of data structure to represents the object. Most common way is HashTable representation.
     This allows for fast access and manipulation.

Structure of Object:
    var obj={
        name:"Preethi",
        Age:29,
        Place:"Coimbatore"
    }
