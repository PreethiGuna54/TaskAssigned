Vlog about Http1.1 & Http2

HTTP 1.1 -> 
Multiplexing:
Loads the resources one by one , so if any of the resources failed to be loaded, remaining resources will be blocked.
Server push:
Server only serves the content to the client device once client asks for it.
Header Compression:
 uses the header compression as small files get pushed up faster.


HTTP 2 ->
Multiplexing:
 Uses single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once, so no resources will be blocked by any other resources.
Server Push:
 Server pushes the content before the client asks for it, also gives the message to client what to expect from the pushed contents 
Header Compression:
 Also uses advanced header compression(HPACK) to compress the HTTP messages, which eliminates the HTTP redundant information in HTTP header packets.
